   <p><b>Direction:A passage is given with 5 questions following it. Read the passage carefully and choose the best answer to each question out of the four alternatives</b></p>
   <p>Although there is a great deal of variation within each gender, on the average, men and women discuss a surprisingly different range of topics. According to some studies, women and men ranging in
      age from seventeen to eighty described the range of topics each discussed with friends of the same sex. Certain topics were common to both men and women; work, movies, and television proved to be frequent topics for both
      groups. The differences between men and women were more striking than the similarities.Female friends spent much more time discussing personal and domestic subjects, relationship problems,
      family, health and reproductive matters, weight, food and clothing. Men, on the other hand, were more likely to discuss music, current events, sports and business. Women were more likely to gossip about close friends and family. By
      contrast, men spent more time gossiping about sports figures and media personalities. These differences can lead to frustration when men and women try to converse with one another.</p>
