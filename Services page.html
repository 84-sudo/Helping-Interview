        And Preplaced’s special feature, which truly proved to be helpful for me was Option to choose mentor from the company of your choice.
        
        This feature is extremely helpful for any candidate as it helps you get the exact exposure as to how the specific company’s interview process or work environment functions. In addition to the interview exposure as a candidate one also gets a mentor and inside edge within their dream company.
        
        In case you're confused, the company has a simple section of check boxes. You just need to tick the ones that apply to you and Preplaced with themselves allot you the most suitable package.
        
        Pricing:
        
        As a student/aspirant we often spend thousands of rupees on several resources that promise to help us in the interview process but at the end of the day we’re left with generalised information and resources which are also easily available on the internet. But with Preplaced, one thing is for sure that you get personalized attention and you can customize what you pay for according to your requirements.
        
        The packages vary depending on the options or combination of options/features you choose. The prices are pretty affordable compared to the offerings it has.
        
        Mock Interviews:
        
        The mock interviews were planned completely according to the candidates preference. It helped me gain a lot of exposure and understanding about the interview process. It not just gives us practice and knowledge but also helps us build confidence for the D-Day.
        
        To conclude in simple words, Preplaced is a fantastic combination of several important features a mock interview platform should have. Its a very helpful resource for all the aspirants looking for mock interview platforms to practice and prepare themselves.
