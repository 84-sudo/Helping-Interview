  <p>A shopkeeper has four different bags i.e. A, B, C and D with four different coloured balls namely Red, Green, Blue and Violet in it.</p>
  <p><b>Bag A:</b> Number of blue balls is 20% more than number of red balls, and number of green balls is 80% more than number of red balls. If one ball is drawn from 
     the bag then the probability of getting a violet ball is 2/7. Number of blue balls in the bag is 12.</p>
  <p><b>Bag B:</b> The ratio of number of violet balls to number of blue balls is 1:3. The ratio of number of blue balls to number of green balls is 5:4 and the ratio of 
     number of red balls to number of green balls is 5:6. Two balls are taken out of the box and the probability of getting one green and one blue ball is 120/581.</p>
  <p><b>Bag C:</b> Total number of balls is 24 more than total number of balls in bag A. Total number of red and blue balls in the bag is 60% of the total number of 
     balls in the bag. The number of red balls is 100% more than number of blue balls and number of violet balls is 40% less than number of green balls</p>
  <p><b>Bag D:</b> Number of violet balls is same as the number of blue balls, and 5 less than number of red balls. Total number of balls in bag D is 10 less than total 
     number of balls in bag C. If one ball is taken out from the bag then the probability of getting a green ball is 2/7.</p>

     <p><b>Argument:</b> Zoos are detrimental to animals' physical health.</p>
     <p><b>1.</b> A study of 35 species of carnivores, including brown bears, cheetahs, and lions, found that zoo enclosures were too small for the animals to carry out 
       their normal routines, which led to problems such as pacing and more infant deaths.<br>

       leading cause of death among gorillas in captivity, while the condition is almost completely absent in the wild.<br>
     <b>3.</b> Because so many diseases can be transmitted from animals to humans, such

  <p><b>(13-15) Directions: Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions.</b></p>
  <p>We frequently hear that drinking a small amount of coffee can be healthy. This always comes back to the evidence that some coffee-drinking is a common 
     behavior among long-lived, healthy people across populations. News stories tend to interpret this evidence optimistically, reporting that coffee may be 
     good for you. _______in reality, it might just be an interesting correlation. Randomized, controlled trials on nutrition are extremely difficult to conduct, as 
     the effects of dietary changes are complex and often take years, if not a lifetime, to reveal themselves. Those who claim that coffee is healthy tend to 
     point to its high level of antioxidants. But antioxidant supplements have not been proven to correlate with health or longevity. Antioxidants represent a 
     vast spectrum of substances. Vitamin E is an antioxidant, and taking vitamin-E supplements has been shown to increase men’s risk of prostate cancer.</p>
  <p>If coffee does have an effect on longevity, it is likely a result of something more global than the potential effect of antioxidants—such as the fact that constant 
     exposure to caffeine, even at low levels, suppresses appetite (in a world where most people eat more than is ideal). Or that it encourages social interaction—it 
     inclines us to go out and do things with people—which itself is generally beneficial to health. These are legitimately positive results. But as with all 
     chemicals, the comprehensive effect of caffeine on our health depends on how, and how much, we use it.</p>
  <p><b>Q:13 </b> Which of the following statements represent author’s view?</p>
  <p><b>1.</b> Coffee is neither beneficial nor harmful to the health of an individual.<br>
     <b>2.</b> The popular perception regarding coffee being healthy and having an impact on longevity has not been backed by any scientific evidence yet.<br>
     <b>3.</b>There is a correlation between coffee and lifestyle of an individual.</p>
