         allowing you to analyze your genuine capabilities and find areas for improvement. In a nutshell, 
         a mock test is an examination that is identical to your real exam but with different facts. </p>
         
         <p>. The questions are in the same structure, and you get the same amount of time to answer them all. 
         Mock tests are simulations of genuine exams that match the exam design but contain different facts.
         After submitting the test, you will be able to view your answers, results, and rank in comparison to
         other participants who have taken the same exam. Mock tests are attended by people from all walks of life.
